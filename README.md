# Beautiful-Bird-World
## Inspiration

I love birds Community - I visited last year with my parents Cornell Lab of Ornithology for birds.
They are dedicated to advancing the understanding and protection of the natural world. At that time I got inspired to do a project on Beautiful Bird World. Birds give a message for kindness and peace. As human beings, we should help the bird community to make their world more beautiful.

 Due to current all kinds of pandemic situations, I wanted to provide community natural relax tools and same time urge them to help the bird community
